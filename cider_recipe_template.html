          <ol>
            <li>Pour cider in to your fermenting vessel.</li>
            <li>Add yeast. Use a starter if it's old or otherwise questionable.</li>
            <li>Once fermentation is complete, bottle. If using priming sugar tablets, use enough for strong carbonation. With average carbonation this turned out slightly too flat.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5 class="section-title">Notes</h5>
            <p>Well, I wasn't lying when I said it was simple.</p>
            <p>Taste-wise, this was amazingly clean and crisp. I was so used to commercial, over-sweetened ciders that this was a real treat. The yeast makes it extremely dry so you can really appreciate the character of the raw ingredients, which in this case was just juice. I'd recommend not cheaping out on it.</p>
            <p>Why are there no gravity readings and an approximate ABV? Well, I kinda forgot to take an initial gravity reading. I took several to make sure fermentation had stopped, but they were ultimately not useful for measuring the alcohol content. Eventually, I bought another bottle of the cider and took a reading from that, which *in theory* should be close enough, but there's no guarantee, this the approximate ABV.</p>
            <p>I used Trader Joes unfiltered apple cider. The quality was fine, but since it's unfiltered the cider was ultimately extremely cloudy. Next time I'm definitely using pectic enzyme to balance that out.</p>
